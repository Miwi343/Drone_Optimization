Idea: Using a genetic algoerithm to optimizing drone swarm coverage.

Objective: Maximing coverage of a drone swarm while minimizing energy consumption.

1. Population

Population of 500 random strategy vectors. Strategy vectors will be comprised of a 
specific set of numeric values used to define the drone behavior.

s = <drone positions, drone velocities, drone altitudes>

drone positions: six floats from 0.0 to 5.0 m. e.g. 
drone velocity: float from 0.0 - 1.0 m/s. 
drone altitude: float from 0.0 - 10.0 m.

2. Fitness Function

Run "simulation", summing up the coverages of the drones every second until energy runs out. 
The rate coverages will increase and the rate at which energy decreases is dependent on the strategy
vector.
There will be 3 drones in every simulation.

3. Selection Method

Rank the generation in order of best strategy (highest fitness scores from the function)

4. Breeding Process

Breed the best strategy vectors (cross breed traits) and randomly mutate traits - 10% probability
of mutation - to produce new offspring. Fill up the next generation with new, different offspring
